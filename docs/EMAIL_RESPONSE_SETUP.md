# Email Response Capturing Setup

Your customer outreach system can send emails, but capturing responses requires additional setup since **Resend doesn't currently support inbound email processing**.

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Email webhook function is ready for when inbound is available
- ✅ Conversation view component added to feedback details  
- ✅ Customer response tracking in database
- ✅ Sentiment analysis for incoming responses
- ✅ Real-time conversation updates

## ⚠️ Resend Limitation

**Resend does not currently support inbound email processing**, which means you can't automatically capture customer replies yet.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use SendGrid (Recommended)
SendGrid supports both outbound and inbound email processing:

1. **Sign up for SendGrid**: https://sendgrid.com/
2. **Configure inbound parsing**: 
   - Set up a subdomain for inbound emails (e.g., `inbound.atlaswe.com`)
   - Configure parse webhook to: `https://frmjdxziwwlfpgevszga.supabase.co/functions/v1/email-webhook`
3. **Update outbound emails** to use SendGrid API instead of Resend

### Option 2: Use Mailgun
Mailgun also supports inbound email processing:

1. **Sign up for Mailgun**: https://www.mailgun.com/
2. **Configure Routes** to forward emails to your webhook
3. **Update email sending** to use Mailgun API

### Option 3: Manual Response Tracking (Current Workaround)
For now, you can manually add customer responses using the conversation view:

1. **Check your email** for customer replies
2. **Open the feedback details** dialog
3. **Use "Add Customer Reply"** to manually log responses
4. **System will analyze sentiment** automatically

## How It Works

### Outbound Emails
1. When you send customer outreach, the system creates an outreach log entry
2. Resend sends delivery status webhooks (sent, delivered, bounced)
3. These are tracked in the `customer_outreach_log` table

### Inbound Email Responses
1. Customer replies to your outreach email
2. Resend forwards the email to your webhook
3. System automatically:
   - Matches reply to original feedback by case number or customer email
   - Performs sentiment analysis
   - Creates inbound message log entry
   - Updates feedback with response info
   - Routes urgent responses to management

### Conversation View
- View complete email conversation history in the feedback details dialog
- See delivery status for outbound messages
- View sentiment analysis for customer responses
- Send follow-up replies with templates or custom messages

## Features Included

### Automatic Response Processing
- **Case Number Matching**: Replies with case numbers are automatically linked
- **Email Matching**: Falls back to customer email for recent feedback
- **New Inquiries**: Creates new feedback records for unknown senders
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive/negative/neutral classification
- **Priority Escalation**: Negative responses auto-escalate to high priority

### Conversation Management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live conversation view with WebSocket updates
- **Template Responses**: Acknowledgment, resolution, praise, escalation templates
- **Custom Messages**: Send personalized replies
- **Manual Entry**: Add customer responses manually if needed
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor email delivery status

### Smart Routing
- **Escalation Detection**: Keywords like "manager", "corporate", "lawsuit" trigger escalation
- **Team Notifications**: Route critical responses to appropriate team members
- **Response Tracking**: Track which feedback items have customer responses

## Testing the System

1. **Send a test outreach email** from the feedback details dialog
2. **Check the conversation view** to see the outbound message
3. **Simulate a customer reply** by using the "Add Customer Reply" feature
4. **Verify the response appears** in the conversation with sentiment analysis

## Database Tables

### `customer_outreach_log`
Stores all email communications (inbound and outbound):
- `direction`: 'inbound' or 'outbound'
- `message_content`: Email content
- `delivery_status`: sent, delivered, bounced, etc.
- `response_sentiment`: positive, negative, neutral
- `email_thread_id`: Groups related messages

### `customer_feedback` Updates
New fields for response tracking:
- `customer_responded_at`: When customer replied
- `customer_response_sentiment`: Overall sentiment
- `outreach_sent_at`: When outreach was sent
- `outreach_method`: Communication method used

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Resend inbound processing** using the steps above
2. **Test with real email responses** once inbound is set up
3. **Train team members** on the conversation view features
4. **Monitor response patterns** using the sentiment analysis data

Your customer feedback system now has full two-way email communication capabilities! 🎉
