## Configuration

### Required Secrets
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Already configured in Supabase

### Supabase Extensions
- `pg_net` - Enabled for async HTTP calls from triggers

### Edge Function Settings
All notification functions are configured with `verify_jwt = false` in `supabase/config.toml`

## Testing

Use the test buttons on the Executive Oversight page:
1. **Test Daily Summary** - Sends Slack DMs to CEO/VP
2. **Test Weekly Summary** - Sends Slack DMs to all Directors/DMs

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### Training Completion Notifications
Could add notifications when:
- R2R training deadlines approach
- Employee completes required training
- Store falls behind on training completion

### Approval Workflow Enhancements
- Reminder notifications for pending approvals
- Escalation if approvals not received within timeframe

## Monitoring

### Check Logs
- Edge function logs: [View Logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/frmjdxziwwlfpgevszga/functions/send-feedback-slack-notification/logs)
- Database logs for trigger execution

### Notification Log
All notifications are tracked in:
- Edge function console logs
- User Slack DMs
- Can add `slack_notifications_log` table if needed

## Security Notes

1. **Service Role Key**: Triggers use `current_setting('app.settings.service_role_key')` which is securely set by Supabase
2. **Slack User IDs**: Cached in `profiles.slack_user_id` to minimize API calls
3. **Email Lookup**: Falls back to Slack API if user ID not cached
4. **RLS**: All database operations respect existing RLS policies

## Troubleshooting

### No Slack DM Received
1. Check edge function logs for errors
2. Verify user's email matches their Slack workspace email
3. Ensure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` has `users:read.email` and `chat:write` permissions
4. Check if Slack user ID was successfully looked up and cached

### Trigger Not Firing
1. Check database logs for trigger execution
2. Verify `pg_net` extension is enabled
3. Check if service role key is properly set
4. Review edge function response in logs

### Wrong Recipients
1. Verify user hierarchy and permissions in database
2. Check `get_executive_hierarchy` RPC function
3. Ensure markets are properly assigned in `user_permissions`
